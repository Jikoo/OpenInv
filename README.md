## For Developers

### As a Dependency

The OpenInv API is available via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).

```xml
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
```

```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.Jikoo</groupId>
      <artifactId>OpenInv</artifactId>
      <version>${openinv.version}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

Note that since JitPack only builds the API now, the "full" OpenInv jar on JitPack is actually the openinvapi artifact.
This is a change from previous dependency declaration that I hope to revert.

### Compilation

Execute the gradle wrapper:  
`./gradlew build`

If you encounter issues with building the Spigot module, try running BuildTools manually.
